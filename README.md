My colleagues and I designed a car that runs on a DC motor and has an ultrasonic sensor in the front connected to a servo so that it can rotate around the entire front of the car to detect if there is something in front of the car so that it does not collide with another object. While the sensor detects an object in front of it, it allows it to reverse and change its lane and then move to another direction to avoid a collision.
